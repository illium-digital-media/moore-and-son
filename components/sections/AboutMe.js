            Hello, I'm Wayne, the driving force behind Moore and Son. With over a decade in the industry, my hands-on experience ranges from intricate interior work to robust exterior finishes. My father handed down not just his brushes, but a legacy of diligence and quality that Moore and Son upholds with every stroke.

At Moore and Son, we cut out the unnecessary to focus on what truly matters â€“ exceptional painting services tailored to your needs.
